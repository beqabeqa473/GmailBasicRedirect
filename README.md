# GMailBasicRedirect
Makes Automatic redirect to Basic html version of Gmail.

# Background
I was using basic html version of gmail for a while as my default view untill google decided to break something and don't allow to set basic version as default anymore, so i decided to help myself to fix that.
My first attempt was to write a tampermonkey userscript to click a button on load of standard view, but it was working slowly, so i decided to write this extension to redirect a request from early beginning.
